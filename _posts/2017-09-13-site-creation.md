title: "Setting up new site"

This is the first post on this new, freely hosted website. This is using GitHub Pages. Turns out GitHub not only stores files for projects, but also hosts static websites. The price remains free so long as there isn't too much strain on their servers. Otherwise they fuss at you.

The GitHub Pages uses software called Jekyll to generate the website. I tried installing it locally on my system, but it's a bit of a rough ride using Windows. It turns out to not be necessary to install it though -- GitHub does all the processing for you. There is a fine [Tutorial Here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) if anyone would like to try it out.

Also of note: A company called [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) offers free DNS names and adds a layer of security to things as well. Multiple boards have suggested that adding this free service to the mix is quite effective. We'll see. I might get to that step tomorrow.
