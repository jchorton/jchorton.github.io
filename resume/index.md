## Experience

### Vocational
* 2022-Current **Data Analyst**, *Randall Reilly*, remote.
* 2018-2022 **Freelance Data Analyst**, *Contractual*.
Apprenticed under a hedge fund manager. This began with using machine learning to search for patterns and later specialized in writing analysis techniques in TradeStation EasyLanguage.
* 2012–2015 **Freelance Writer**, *Contractual*.  
Penned two science-fiction novels. Summarized statistics textbook for Chegg.
* 2005–2008 **Graduate Research Assistant**, *Indiana University*, Bloomington, IN.  
Worked on projects with two different teams at the IU Cyclotron Facility. The tasks included the design and construction of an adiabatic spin flipper, simulation of neutron scattering angles from a superfluid, and assistance in the development of a fiber-optic-based neutral particle detector.

### Miscellaneous
* 2013–2015 **Website Design**.  
Designed and maintained website for sale of a novel. Later just switched to using Amazon promotions.
